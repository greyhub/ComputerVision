## 1. Remind
### Digital images
    - What does the machine see?
      - A matrix of pixels
      - 1 pixel:
        - A intensity value: 0-255
        - Black: 0
        - White: 255
### Principal type of images
    - Binary image
    - Gray image
    - Color image
    - Other: multi-spectre, depth image
### Modification of images values
    - Isolated tranformations
    - Local transformations
    - Global transformations
## 2. Point processing
### Point operators
### Histogram and histogram egalization
    - The output at one point depends only on that point but not other neighborhoods
      - s = T(r)
    - Homogenous transformation
    - Linear / Non-linear transformation
    - Contrast stretching
    - Thresholding function
    - Some basic gray level transformations
        - Image nagatives
        - Log transformations
        - Power-law transformations
        - Piecewise-linear transformations functions
        - Histogram processing
